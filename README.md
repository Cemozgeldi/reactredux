#react-redux project

In this project, I tried to examine the use of redux in detail. We created a modal structure where we can choose the product name, product price and product photo. We also added the update or deletion feature to the product cards we created thanks to redux. At the same time, product search or sorting functions have been added thanks to filtering between products. I hope you like it.
